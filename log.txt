    [notes] => One key to perfect pesto is chopping all the ingredients by hand, preferably with a sharp mezzaluna or knife. This pesto will keep a bit in the refrigerator, but it really hits its peak when served soon after it is made. The technique here is: chop a bit, add some ingredients, chop some more. I think part of the reason she does it this way (instead of chopping everything all at once) is because some things get chopped into oblivion, while some, not as much - it encourages spectrum of cut sizes throughout the pesto contributing to the overall texture. All told, the chopping took me a leisurely twenty to thirty minutes, I wasn't in any particular rush.

You'll also notice this recipe doesn't have any added salt (just the saltiness from the cheese), make sure your pasta water is well salted if you are going to use this pesto on pasta or the overall flavor profile will fall flat. Also, be sure to adjust for seasoning before serving. With food this simple, you need to get the seasoning right. Trust your tastebuds.

Start chopping the garlic along with about 1/3 of the basil leaves. Once this is loosely chopped add more basil, chop some more, add the rest of the basil, chop some more. I scrape and chop, gather and chop. At this point the basil and garlic should be a very fine mince. Add about half the pine nuts, chop. Add the rest of the pine nuts, chop. Add half of the Parmesan, chop. Add the rest of the Parmesan, and chop. In the end you want a chop so fine that you can press all the ingredients into a basil 'cake' - see the photo up above. Transfer the pesto 'cake' to a small bowl (not much bigger than the cake).

Form a Paste
Cover the pesto 'cake' with a bit of olive oil. It doesn't take much, just a few tablespoons. At this point, you can set the pesto aside, or place it in the refrigerator until you are ready to use it. Just before serving, give the pesto a quick stir to incorporate some of the oil into the basil. Francesca's mom occasionally thins the pesto with a splash of pasta water for more coverage, but for our gnocchi this wasn't necessary.

Cover the pesto 'cake' with a bit of olive oil. It doesn't take much, just a few tablespoons. At this point, you can set the pesto aside, or place it in the refrigerator until you are ready to use it. Just before serving, give the pesto a quick stir to incorporate some of the oil into the basil. Francesca's mom occasionally thins the pesto with a splash of pasta water for more coverage, but for our gnocchi this wasn't necessary.

    [directions] => Prep the oven and skillet. Heat oven to 400°F.  Add the butter to a 9-inch or 10-inch cast iron skillet, then transfer the skillet to the oven.
Brown the butter.  While you prepare steps 3 and 4 (below), let the butter melt and simmer in the oven until it is lightly browned and smells toasty, keeping a very close eye on it so that the butter does not accidentally burn.  Use an oven mitt to remove the pan from the oven, then carefully swirl the melted butter to coat the edges of the skillet, and pour the browned butter into a separate bowl until ready to use.  (Or if you’ve already reached step 5, you can go ahead and just pour the browned butter directly into the batter after the buttermilk mixture.)
Combine the dry ingredients. Meanwhile, in a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, cornmeal, baking powder, baking soda and fine sea salt until combined.
Combine the wet ingredients. In a separate small mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs and honey until evenly combined.  Add the buttermilk and whisk until combined.
Finish the batter. Create a well in the center of the dry ingredient bowl, and pour the buttermilk mixture into the well.  Gently whisk the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until just combined.  Pour the melted butter into the batter and stir until it is just combined, taking care not to over-mix the batter.
Bake. Pour the batter evenly into the cast iron skillet.  Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cornbread comes out clean.
Cool. Carefully transfer the skillet to a wire cooling rack and let the cornbread cool for at least 10 minutes.  Then slice, serve, and enjoy!

    [notes] => One key to perfect pesto is chopping all the ingredients by hand, preferably with a sharp mezzaluna or knife. This pesto will keep a bit in the refrigerator, but it really hits its peak when served soon after it is made. The technique here is: chop a bit, add some ingredients, chop some more. I think part of the reason she does it this way (instead of chopping everything all at once) is because some things get chopped into oblivion, while some, not as much - it encourages spectrum of cut sizes throughout the pesto contributing to the overall texture. All told, the chopping took me a leisurely twenty to thirty minutes, I wasn't in any particular rush.

You'll also notice this recipe doesn't have any added salt (just the saltiness from the cheese), make sure your pasta water is well salted if you are going to use this pesto on pasta or the overall flavor profile will fall flat. Also, be sure to adjust for seasoning before serving. With food this simple, you need to get the seasoning right. Trust your tastebuds.

Start chopping the garlic along with about 1/3 of the basil leaves. Once this is loosely chopped add more basil, chop some more, add the rest of the basil, chop some more. I scrape and chop, gather and chop. At this point the basil and garlic should be a very fine mince. Add about half the pine nuts, chop. Add the rest of the pine nuts, chop. Add half of the Parmesan, chop. Add the rest of the Parmesan, and chop. In the end you want a chop so fine that you can press all the ingredients into a basil 'cake' - see the photo up above. Transfer the pesto 'cake' to a small bowl (not much bigger than the cake).

    [notes] => One key to perfect pesto is chopping all the ingredients by hand, preferably with a sharp mezzaluna or knife. This pesto will keep a bit in the refrigerator, but it really hits its peak when served soon after it is made. The technique here is: chop a bit, add some ingredients, chop some more. I think part of the reason she does it this way (instead of chopping everything all at once) is because some things get chopped into oblivion, while some, not as much - it encourages spectrum of cut sizes throughout the pesto contributing to the overall texture. All told, the chopping took me a leisurely twenty to thirty minutes, I wasn't in any particular rush.

You'll also notice this recipe doesn't have any added salt (just the saltiness from the cheese), make sure your pasta water is well salted if you are going to use this pesto on pasta or the overall flavor profile will fall flat. Also, be sure to adjust for seasoning before serving. With food this simple, you need to get the seasoning right. Trust your tastebuds.

Start chopping the garlic along with about 1/3 of the basil leaves. Once this is loosely chopped add more basil, chop some more, add the rest of the basil, chop some more. I scrape and chop, gather and chop. At this point the basil and garlic should be a very fine mince. Add about half the pine nuts, chop. Add the rest of the pine nuts, chop. Add half of the Parmesan, chop. Add the rest of the Parmesan, and chop. In the end you want a chop so fine that you can press all the ingredients into a basil 'cake' - see the photo up above. Transfer the pesto 'cake' to a small bowl (not much bigger than the cake).

Form a Paste
Cover the pesto 'cake' with a bit of olive oil. It doesn't take much, just a few tablespoons. At this point, you can set the pesto aside, or place it in the refrigerator until you are ready to use it. Just before serving, give the pesto a quick stir to incorporate some of the oil into the basil. Francesca's mom occasionally thins the pesto with a splash of pasta water for more coverage, but for our gnocchi this wasn't necessary.

    [directions] => Prep the oven and skillet. Heat oven to 400°F.  Add the butter to a 9-inch or 10-inch cast iron skillet, then transfer the skillet to the oven.
Brown the butter.  While you prepare steps 3 and 4 (below), let the butter melt and simmer in the oven until it is lightly browned and smells toasty, keeping a very close eye on it so that the butter does not accidentally burn.  Use an oven mitt to remove the pan from the oven, then carefully swirl the melted butter to coat the edges of the skillet, and pour the browned butter into a separate bowl until ready to use.  (Or if you’ve already reached step 5, you can go ahead and just pour the browned butter directly into the batter after the buttermilk mixture.)
Combine the dry ingredients. Meanwhile, in a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, cornmeal, baking powder, baking soda and fine sea salt until combined.
Combine the wet ingredients. In a separate small mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs and honey until evenly combined.  Add the buttermilk and whisk until combined.
Finish the batter. Create a well in the center of the dry ingredient bowl, and pour the buttermilk mixture into the well.  Gently whisk the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until just combined.  Pour the melted butter into the batter and stir until it is just combined, taking care not to over-mix the batter.
Bake. Pour the batter evenly into the cast iron skillet.  Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cornbread comes out clean.
Cool. Carefully transfer the skillet to a wire cooling rack and let the cornbread cool for at least 10 minutes.  Then slice, serve, and enjoy!

You'll also notice this recipe doesn't have any added salt (just the saltiness from the cheese), make sure your pasta water is well salted if you are going to use this pesto on pasta or the overall flavor profile will fall flat. Also, be sure to adjust for seasoning before serving. With food this simple, you need to get the seasoning right. Trust your tastebuds.

Transfer the pesto 'cake' to a small bowl (not much bigger than the cake).

Form a Paste
Cover the pesto 'cake' with a bit of olive oil. It doesn't take much, just a few tablespoons. At this point, you can set the pesto aside, or place it in the refrigerator until you are ready to use it. Just before serving, give the pesto a quick stir to incorporate some of the oil into the basil. Francesca's mom occasionally thins the pesto with a splash of pasta water for more coverage, but for our gnocchi this wasn't necessary.
    [7] => Chop Ingredients
Start chopping the garlic along with about 1/3 of the basil leaves. Once this is loosely chopped add more basil, chop some more, add the rest of the basil, chop some more.

    [notes] => One key to perfect pesto is chopping all the ingredients by hand, preferably with a sharp mezzaluna or knife. This pesto will keep a bit in the refrigerator, but it really hits its peak when served soon after it is made. The technique here is: chop a bit, add some ingredients, chop some more. I think part of the reason she does it this way (instead of chopping everything all at once) is because some things get chopped into oblivion, while some, not as much - it encourages spectrum of cut sizes throughout the pesto contributing to the overall texture. All told, the chopping took me a leisurely twenty to thirty minutes, I wasn't in any particular rush.

You'll also notice this recipe doesn't have any added salt (just the saltiness from the cheese), make sure your pasta water is well salted if you are going to use this pesto on pasta or the overall flavor profile will fall flat. Also, be sure to adjust for seasoning before serving. With food this simple, you need to get the seasoning right. Trust your tastebuds.
