    [notes] => One key to perfect pesto is chopping all the ingredients by hand, preferably with a sharp mezzaluna or knife. This pesto will keep a bit in the refrigerator, but it really hits its peak when served soon after it is made. The technique here is: chop a bit, add some ingredients, chop some more. I think part of the reason she does it this way (instead of chopping everything all at once) is because some things get chopped into oblivion, while some, not as much - it encourages spectrum of cut sizes throughout the pesto contributing to the overall texture. All told, the chopping took me a leisurely twenty to thirty minutes, I wasn't in any particular rush.

You'll also notice this recipe doesn't have any added salt (just the saltiness from the cheese), make sure your pasta water is well salted if you are going to use this pesto on pasta or the overall flavor profile will fall flat. Also, be sure to adjust for seasoning before serving. With food this simple, you need to get the seasoning right. Trust your tastebuds.

Start chopping the garlic along with about 1/3 of the basil leaves. Once this is loosely chopped add more basil, chop some more, add the rest of the basil, chop some more. I scrape and chop, gather and chop. At this point the basil and garlic should be a very fine mince. Add about half the pine nuts, chop. Add the rest of the pine nuts, chop. Add half of the Parmesan, chop. Add the rest of the Parmesan, and chop. In the end you want a chop so fine that you can press all the ingredients into a basil 'cake' - see the photo up above. Transfer the pesto 'cake' to a small bowl (not much bigger than the cake).

Form a Paste
Cover the pesto 'cake' with a bit of olive oil. It doesn't take much, just a few tablespoons. At this point, you can set the pesto aside, or place it in the refrigerator until you are ready to use it. Just before serving, give the pesto a quick stir to incorporate some of the oil into the basil. Francesca's mom occasionally thins the pesto with a splash of pasta water for more coverage, but for our gnocchi this wasn't necessary.

Cover the pesto 'cake' with a bit of olive oil. It doesn't take much, just a few tablespoons. At this point, you can set the pesto aside, or place it in the refrigerator until you are ready to use it. Just before serving, give the pesto a quick stir to incorporate some of the oil into the basil. Francesca's mom occasionally thins the pesto with a splash of pasta water for more coverage, but for our gnocchi this wasn't necessary.

    [directions] => Prep the oven and skillet. Heat oven to 400°F.  Add the butter to a 9-inch or 10-inch cast iron skillet, then transfer the skillet to the oven.
Brown the butter.  While you prepare steps 3 and 4 (below), let the butter melt and simmer in the oven until it is lightly browned and smells toasty, keeping a very close eye on it so that the butter does not accidentally burn.  Use an oven mitt to remove the pan from the oven, then carefully swirl the melted butter to coat the edges of the skillet, and pour the browned butter into a separate bowl until ready to use.  (Or if you’ve already reached step 5, you can go ahead and just pour the browned butter directly into the batter after the buttermilk mixture.)
Combine the dry ingredients. Meanwhile, in a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, cornmeal, baking powder, baking soda and fine sea salt until combined.
Combine the wet ingredients. In a separate small mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs and honey until evenly combined.  Add the buttermilk and whisk until combined.
Finish the batter. Create a well in the center of the dry ingredient bowl, and pour the buttermilk mixture into the well.  Gently whisk the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until just combined.  Pour the melted butter into the batter and stir until it is just combined, taking care not to over-mix the batter.
Bake. Pour the batter evenly into the cast iron skillet.  Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cornbread comes out clean.
Cool. Carefully transfer the skillet to a wire cooling rack and let the cornbread cool for at least 10 minutes.  Then slice, serve, and enjoy!

    [notes] => One key to perfect pesto is chopping all the ingredients by hand, preferably with a sharp mezzaluna or knife. This pesto will keep a bit in the refrigerator, but it really hits its peak when served soon after it is made. The technique here is: chop a bit, add some ingredients, chop some more. I think part of the reason she does it this way (instead of chopping everything all at once) is because some things get chopped into oblivion, while some, not as much - it encourages spectrum of cut sizes throughout the pesto contributing to the overall texture. All told, the chopping took me a leisurely twenty to thirty minutes, I wasn't in any particular rush.

You'll also notice this recipe doesn't have any added salt (just the saltiness from the cheese), make sure your pasta water is well salted if you are going to use this pesto on pasta or the overall flavor profile will fall flat. Also, be sure to adjust for seasoning before serving. With food this simple, you need to get the seasoning right. Trust your tastebuds.

Start chopping the garlic along with about 1/3 of the basil leaves. Once this is loosely chopped add more basil, chop some more, add the rest of the basil, chop some more. I scrape and chop, gather and chop. At this point the basil and garlic should be a very fine mince. Add about half the pine nuts, chop. Add the rest of the pine nuts, chop. Add half of the Parmesan, chop. Add the rest of the Parmesan, and chop. In the end you want a chop so fine that you can press all the ingredients into a basil 'cake' - see the photo up above. Transfer the pesto 'cake' to a small bowl (not much bigger than the cake).

    [notes] => One key to perfect pesto is chopping all the ingredients by hand, preferably with a sharp mezzaluna or knife. This pesto will keep a bit in the refrigerator, but it really hits its peak when served soon after it is made. The technique here is: chop a bit, add some ingredients, chop some more. I think part of the reason she does it this way (instead of chopping everything all at once) is because some things get chopped into oblivion, while some, not as much - it encourages spectrum of cut sizes throughout the pesto contributing to the overall texture. All told, the chopping took me a leisurely twenty to thirty minutes, I wasn't in any particular rush.

You'll also notice this recipe doesn't have any added salt (just the saltiness from the cheese), make sure your pasta water is well salted if you are going to use this pesto on pasta or the overall flavor profile will fall flat. Also, be sure to adjust for seasoning before serving. With food this simple, you need to get the seasoning right. Trust your tastebuds.

Start chopping the garlic along with about 1/3 of the basil leaves. Once this is loosely chopped add more basil, chop some more, add the rest of the basil, chop some more. I scrape and chop, gather and chop. At this point the basil and garlic should be a very fine mince. Add about half the pine nuts, chop. Add the rest of the pine nuts, chop. Add half of the Parmesan, chop. Add the rest of the Parmesan, and chop. In the end you want a chop so fine that you can press all the ingredients into a basil 'cake' - see the photo up above. Transfer the pesto 'cake' to a small bowl (not much bigger than the cake).

Form a Paste
Cover the pesto 'cake' with a bit of olive oil. It doesn't take much, just a few tablespoons. At this point, you can set the pesto aside, or place it in the refrigerator until you are ready to use it. Just before serving, give the pesto a quick stir to incorporate some of the oil into the basil. Francesca's mom occasionally thins the pesto with a splash of pasta water for more coverage, but for our gnocchi this wasn't necessary.

    [directions] => Prep the oven and skillet. Heat oven to 400°F.  Add the butter to a 9-inch or 10-inch cast iron skillet, then transfer the skillet to the oven.
Brown the butter.  While you prepare steps 3 and 4 (below), let the butter melt and simmer in the oven until it is lightly browned and smells toasty, keeping a very close eye on it so that the butter does not accidentally burn.  Use an oven mitt to remove the pan from the oven, then carefully swirl the melted butter to coat the edges of the skillet, and pour the browned butter into a separate bowl until ready to use.  (Or if you’ve already reached step 5, you can go ahead and just pour the browned butter directly into the batter after the buttermilk mixture.)
Combine the dry ingredients. Meanwhile, in a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, cornmeal, baking powder, baking soda and fine sea salt until combined.
Combine the wet ingredients. In a separate small mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs and honey until evenly combined.  Add the buttermilk and whisk until combined.
Finish the batter. Create a well in the center of the dry ingredient bowl, and pour the buttermilk mixture into the well.  Gently whisk the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until just combined.  Pour the melted butter into the batter and stir until it is just combined, taking care not to over-mix the batter.
Bake. Pour the batter evenly into the cast iron skillet.  Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cornbread comes out clean.
Cool. Carefully transfer the skillet to a wire cooling rack and let the cornbread cool for at least 10 minutes.  Then slice, serve, and enjoy!

You'll also notice this recipe doesn't have any added salt (just the saltiness from the cheese), make sure your pasta water is well salted if you are going to use this pesto on pasta or the overall flavor profile will fall flat. Also, be sure to adjust for seasoning before serving. With food this simple, you need to get the seasoning right. Trust your tastebuds.

Transfer the pesto 'cake' to a small bowl (not much bigger than the cake).

Form a Paste
Cover the pesto 'cake' with a bit of olive oil. It doesn't take much, just a few tablespoons. At this point, you can set the pesto aside, or place it in the refrigerator until you are ready to use it. Just before serving, give the pesto a quick stir to incorporate some of the oil into the basil. Francesca's mom occasionally thins the pesto with a splash of pasta water for more coverage, but for our gnocchi this wasn't necessary.

    [notes] => One key to perfect pesto is chopping all the ingredients by hand, preferably with a sharp mezzaluna or knife. This pesto will keep a bit in the refrigerator, but it really hits its peak when served soon after it is made. The technique here is: chop a bit, add some ingredients, chop some more. I think part of the reason she does it this way (instead of chopping everything all at once) is because some things get chopped into oblivion, while some, not as much - it encourages spectrum of cut sizes throughout the pesto contributing to the overall texture. All told, the chopping took me a leisurely twenty to thirty minutes, I wasn't in any particular rush.

You'll also notice this recipe doesn't have any added salt (just the saltiness from the cheese), make sure your pasta water is well salted if you are going to use this pesto on pasta or the overall flavor profile will fall flat. Also, be sure to adjust for seasoning before serving. With food this simple, you need to get the seasoning right. Trust your tastebuds.

    [directions] => Prep the oven and skillet. Heat oven to 400°F.  Add the butter to a 9-inch or 10-inch cast iron skillet, then transfer the skillet to the oven.
Brown the butter.  While you prepare steps 3 and 4 (below), let the butter melt and simmer in the oven until it is lightly browned and smells toasty, keeping a very close eye on it so that the butter does not accidentally burn.  Use an oven mitt to remove the pan from the oven, then carefully swirl the melted butter to coat the edges of the skillet, and pour the browned butter into a separate bowl until ready to use.  (Or if you’ve already reached step 5, you can go ahead and just pour the browned butter directly into the batter after the buttermilk mixture.)
Combine the dry ingredients. Meanwhile, in a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, cornmeal, baking powder, baking soda and fine sea salt until combined.
Combine the wet ingredients. In a separate small mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs and honey until evenly combined.  Add the buttermilk and whisk until combined.
Finish the batter. Create a well in the center of the dry ingredient bowl, and pour the buttermilk mixture into the well.  Gently whisk the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until just combined.  Pour the melted butter into the batter and stir until it is just combined, taking care not to over-mix the batter.
Bake. Pour the batter evenly into the cast iron skillet.  Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cornbread comes out clean.
Cool. Carefully transfer the skillet to a wire cooling rack and let the cornbread cool for at least 10 minutes.  Then slice, serve, and enjoy!
    [7] => Prep the oven and skillet. Heat oven to 400°F.  Add the butter to a 9-inch or 10-inch cast iron skillet, then transfer the skillet to the oven.
Brown the butter.  While you prepare steps 3 and 4 (below), let the butter melt and simmer in the oven until it is lightly browned and smells toasty, keeping a very close eye on it so that the butter does not accidentally burn.  Use an oven mitt to remove the pan from the oven, then carefully swirl the melted butter to coat the edges of the skillet, and pour the browned butter into a separate bowl until ready to use.  (Or if you’ve already reached step 5, you can go ahead and just pour the browned butter directly into the batter after the buttermilk mixture.)

    [directions] => Prep the oven and skillet. Heat oven to 400°F.  Add the butter to a 9-inch or 10-inch cast iron skillet, then transfer the skillet to the oven.
Brown the butter.  While you prepare steps 3 and 4 (below), let the butter melt and simmer in the oven until it is lightly browned and smells toasty, keeping a very close eye on it so that the butter does not accidentally burn.  Use an oven mitt to remove the pan from the oven, then carefully swirl the melted butter to coat the edges of the skillet, and pour the browned butter into a separate bowl until ready to use.  (Or if you’ve already reached step 5, you can go ahead and just pour the browned butter directly into the batter after the buttermilk mixture.)
Combine the dry ingredients. Meanwhile, in a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, cornmeal, baking powder, baking soda and fine sea salt until combined.
Combine the wet ingredients. In a separate small mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs and honey until evenly combined.  Add the buttermilk and whisk until combined.
Finish the batter. Create a well in the center of the dry ingredient bowl, and pour the buttermilk mixture into the well.  Gently whisk the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until just combined.  Pour the melted butter into the batter and stir until it is just combined, taking care not to over-mix the batter.
Bake. Pour the batter evenly into the cast iron skillet.  Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cornbread comes out clean.
Cool. Carefully transfer the skillet to a wire cooling rack and let the cornbread cool for at least 10 minutes.  Then slice, serve, and enjoy!

    [directions] => Heat oven to 350°F.  Prepare a 12-cup muffin pan by either greasing it with cooking spray or lining the cups with paper liners.  Set aside.
In a large mixing bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon and salt until combined.  Set aside.
In a separate mixing bowl, whisk together egg, maple syrup, milk, coconut oil and vanilla extract until combined.  Pour this mixture into the dry ingredient mixture, and stir with a spoon until just combined.  (Do not overmix.)  Stir in the zucchini and oats until just combined.
Portion the batter evenly between 12 baking cups.  Then sprinkle extra oats on top of each, if desired.  Bake for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center of the muffin comes out clean.  Transfer pan to a cooling rack, then serve the muffins warm.  Or let cool to room temperature, then store in a sealed container for up to 2 days, or freeze.

    [name] => Jambalaya
    [notes] => Hands-down the best jambalaya recipe! It is surprisingly easy to make, customizable with your favorite proteins (I used chicken, shrimp and Andouille sausage), and full of bold, zesty, Cajun flavors that everyone will love.
    [servings] => 6
    [prep_time] => 15
    [cook_time] => 40
    [directions] => Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a stock pot (or a very large, deep sauté pan) over medium-high heat.  Add the chicken and sausage and sauté for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is cooked through and the sausage is lightly browned.  Transfer to a clean plate and set aside.
Add the remaining 2 tablespoons oil to the stock pot.  Add bell peppers, celery, jalapeño, onion and garlic. Sauté for 6 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the onions are softened.
Add the crushed tomatoes, chicken stock, rice, Cajun seasoning, thyme, cayenne, bay leaf, and stir to combine.  Continue cooking until the mixture reaches a simmer.  Then reduce heat to medium-low, cover and simmer for about 25-30 minutes, or until the rice is nearly cooked through, stirring every 5 minutes or so along the way so that the rice does not burn.
Add the shrimp, okra, and stir to combine. Continue to simmer, stirring occasionally, until the shrimp are cooked through and pink. Stir in the chicken and sausage, and remove and discard the bay leaf.
Taste season the jambalaya with salt, pepper, and additional Cajun seasoning if needed.  (I typically add about 2 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.)  Remove from heat.
Serve warm with your desired garnishes.  Or refrigerate and store in a sealed container for up to 3 days.

    [name] => Grilled Halloumi Salad
    [notes] => This Mediterranean-inspired grilled halloumi salad is made with pan-grilled halloumi cheese, chewy farro, fresh cucumber and greens and herbs, and a zippy lemon dressing. See notes above for optional add-ins too!
    [servings] => 6
    [prep_time] => 25
    [cook_time] => 15
    [directions] => Cook the farro. Cook the farro in 3 cups of water or vegetable stock according to these instructions until it is chewy and tender. (Cooking time will vary depending on what type of farro you use.) Drain the farro in a fine-mesh strainer and add it to a large mixing bowl.*
Make the dressing. Meanwhile, whisk all ingredients together in a small bowl (or shake in a covered mason jar) until completely combined. Set aside until ready to use.
Pan-grill the halloumi. Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large grill pan or sauté pan over high heat. Add however many halloumi strips that you can fit in an even layer, then cook for about 30 seconds per side or until the cheese is lightly browned. Transfer the halloumi to the large mixing bowl with the farro, then repeat with the remaining strips until all of the halloumi has been cooked.
Toss the salad. Add the remaining ingredients (arugula, cucumber, red onion, mint, Kalamata olives and pine nuts) to the large mixing bowl. Drizzle evenly with the dressing, and then toss until the salad is completely combined.
Season. Taste and season the salad with extra salt, black pepper and/or lemon juice, if needed.
Serve. Serve immediately and enjoy!

    [name] => Hummingbird Cake
    [notes] => This delicious hummingbird cake recipe features ultra-moist tropical pineapple banana cake layered with rich cream cheese frosting and a sprinkle of toasted pecans.
    [servings] => 12
    [prep_time] => 30
    [cook_time] => 30
    [directions] => Prep the oven and cake pans. Heat oven to 350°F. Grease and flour three 8-inch* cake pans, tapping out any excess flour.
Mix the cake batter. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, cinnamon, baking soda, salt, cardamom, and ginger until combined. Add the eggs, oil and vanilla extract, stirring until the ingredients just combined and no dry streaks remain. (Try to avoid over-mixing.) Add the bananas, pineapple and pecans and stir until evenly combined.
Bake. Portion the batter evenly between the three cake pans. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cakes comes out clean. Transfer the cakes to a wire rack and let them cool completely to room temperature before frosting.
Mix the frosting. In a large mixing bowl (or see stand mixer option below), whisk together the cream cheese, butter, vanilla extract and salt until evenly combined. Gradually add in the powdered sugar until incorporated, then whisk the frosting vigorously for 1 to 2 minutes until smooth and fluffy. If the frosting seems too thin, add extra powdered sugar. If it seems too thick, add in a tablespoon or two of water.
Assemble the cake. Place one cake layer on a cake stand or serving plate. Spread about 1 cup of frosting evenly on top of the cake, extending over the edges. Repeat with a second layer of cake, followed by an additional 1 cup of frosting. Repeat with the third layer of cake, then spread the remaining frosting evenly over the top and sides of the cake until smooth. Sprinkle extra chopped pecans on the cake as decoration, if desired.
Serve. Slice, serve and enjoy!

    [name] => Healthy Carrot Cake Muffins
    [notes] => These Healthy Carrot Cake Muffins are easy to make with oatmeal, lots of fresh carrots, and a handful of other simple and healthy ingredients. Feel free to top them with a lightened-up cream cheese drizzle too!


    [servings] => 12
    [prep_time] => 15
    [cook_time] => 30
    [directions] => Prep oven and muffin pan. Preheat oven to 375°F. Line a 12-cup muffin pan with baking liners, or lightly grease with cooking spray.  Set aside.
Purée oats. Purée the oats in a blender or food processor until they reach a flour-like consistency. Add in the baking soda, cinnamon, sea salt, ginger, nutmeg, and pulse a few more times until the mixture is evenly combined. Set aside.
Mix the ingredients. In a separate large mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, shredded carrots, maple syrup, coconut oil and vanilla extract until evenly combined.  Fold the oatmeal mixture in with the wet ingredient mixture, along with any optional add-ins, and stir until the mixture is just combined.  (Try to avoid over-mixing.)
Prep the baking cups. Portion the batter evenly into prepared baking cups.  Then sprinkle a generous pinch of turbinado sugar on top of each cup of muffin batter, if you would like.
Bake. Bake for 15-18 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center of the muffins comes out clean.  Remove from the oven and place the pan on a wire cooling rack until the muffins cool to room temperature.
Make the cream cheese drizzle. While the muffins bake, whisk together the cream cheese drizzle ingredients in a small mixing bowl until smooth. If the drizzle seems too thin, add in a few extra tablespoons of powdered sugar. If it is too thick, add in a tiny extra splash of milk.
Serve. Once the muffins have cooled to room temperature, use a fork or a piping bag to top each muffin with your desired amount of cream cheese drizzle. Serve immediately, or transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate the muffins for up to 3 days or freeze for up to 3 months.
